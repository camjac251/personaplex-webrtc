PersonaPlex is a real-time, full-duplex speech-to-speech model with persona control via text prompts and voice conditioning. This fork defaults to Kyutai's interactivity-aligned PersonaPlex checkpoint and packages it as a single-template RunPod deployment with a WebRTC browser client and a one-shot bootstrap script.

## Deploy on RunPod

### 1. HuggingFace token

Create a **Read** token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and accept the gated license at [kyutai/personaplex-rl-seamless](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/personaplex-rl-seamless). The RL checkpoint combines CC BY-NC 4.0 with the NVIDIA Open Model License and is non-commercial. To use the base-model rollback, also accept [nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1).

### 2. Cloudflare TURN credentials

WebRTC media is UDP. RunPod's `*.proxy.runpod.net` is Cloudflare-fronted and only carries HTTP/WS, so the browser needs a TURN relay to reach the pod. Cloudflare's free tier covers a personal voice agent comfortably (1 TB egress/month).

1. Sign in to Cloudflare. Dashboard -> **Realtime** -> **TURN Server**.
2. Click **Create TURN App**, name it.
3. Copy the **Turn Token ID** and **API Token**. The API token is shown once. Lose it and you regenerate.

### 3. RunPod secrets

In the RunPod console, go to **Secrets** -> **Create secret** and add the following. `GEMINI_API_KEY` is optional and only required if you want the Vision feature.

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace Read token |
| `TURN_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare Turn Token ID |
| `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API Token |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio key (optional; enables Vision) |

### 4. Build the custom image

The one-shot bootstrap path below still works, but a fresh Pod has to
recreate the Python environment and download large Torch/CUDA wheels. For
repeated launches, use the GitHub Actions workflow in this repo to build and
publish the image to GitHub Container Registry:

- Push to `main`, push a `v*.*.*` tag, or run **Docker image** manually from
  the Actions tab.
- The workflow publishes `ghcr.io/camjac251/personaplex-runpod:latest` on
  `main`, branch/tag names for matching refs, and `sha-<commit>` tags for every
  non-PR build.

The image bakes the repo and Python dependencies. It does **not** bake
HuggingFace model weights, voice prompts, or secrets. Those download on first
start into `/workspace` and are reused when the same Pod is stopped/started, or
when you attach a network volume that already has the cache. If the GHCR
package is private, either make it public or add registry authentication in the
RunPod template.

### 5. Pod template

Create a Pod template (Templates -> New Template). Settings:

- **Type**: Pod
- **Compute**: NVIDIA GPU
- **Container image**: `ghcr.io/camjac251/personaplex-runpod:latest`
- **Container disk**: 60 GB
- **Volume disk**: 60 GB minimum, 80 GB comfortable
- **Volume mount path**: `/workspace`

**Container start command**: leave blank so the image `CMD` runs. If the
console requires a value, use:

```bash
/opt/personaplex-runpod/docker/runpod-start.sh
```

**HTTP ports**: `8998` (PersonaPlex). `8888` (JupyterLab) is optional.

**TCP ports**: none.

**Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_HF_TOKEN }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_ID` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_ID }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN }}` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (optional) |
| `PERSONAPLEX_MODEL` | `rl-seamless` (default) or `base` |
| `PERSONAPLEX_HF_REPO` | Custom model repository override (optional) |
| `PERSONAPLEX_HF_REVISION` | Override the pinned tested model revision (optional) |

The launcher defaults to the pinned Seamless RL checkpoint. Set
`PERSONAPLEX_MODEL=base` to roll back to the pinned NVIDIA base checkpoint.
Both aliases select a matching immutable revision automatically, so restarting
an unchanged image cannot silently pick up different assets. A custom
`PERSONAPLEX_HF_REPO` must be paired with `PERSONAPLEX_HF_REVISION`. Launchers
ignore the old NVIDIA revision pin when it is the only model variable left in
an existing pod; set `PERSONAPLEX_MODEL=base` when that rollback is intended.

Use **Stop** / **Start** on the same Pod to keep `/workspace`. Terminating a
regular Pod deletes its volume disk; use a network volume if you need the cache
to survive Pod deletion or move between Pods.

#### Bootstrap fallback

If you do not want to build an image yet, use the base image and bootstrap
script. This path is slower on any fresh `/workspace` volume.

- **Container image**: `runpod/base:1.0.7-cuda1281-ubuntu2404`
- **Container disk**: 20 GB
- **Volume disk**: 60 GB minimum
- **Volume mount path**: `/workspace`

**Container start command**:

```bash
bash -c "curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camjac251/Personaplex-runpod/main/start.sh -o /workspace/start.sh && chmod +x /workspace/start.sh && /workspace/start.sh & /start.sh"
```

**HTTP ports**: `8998` (PersonaPlex). `8888` (JupyterLab) is optional.

**TCP ports**: none.

**Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_HF_TOKEN }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_ID` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_ID }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN }}` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (optional) |
| `PERSONAPLEX_MODEL` | `rl-seamless` (default) or `base` |

### 6. Launch and connect

Use a GPU with at least 24 GB VRAM for the default resident model plus rewind
snapshot (RTX 4090 / A6000 / L40S all work). Lower-memory cards require CPU
offload and have substantially higher latency.

First boot downloads the 16.7 GB model plus tokenizer and voice assets. Expect 30-60 minutes depending on the data centre. The volume disk caches them, so subsequent boots reach "ready" in under a minute. Keeping both RL and base checkpoints requires space for both model weight files.

The dashboard reports the active repository, revision, and license. Checkpoint
selection stays at pod startup because hot-swapping an 8B model would discard
CUDA graphs, snapshots, and the live conversation. Use separate templates or
restart with `PERSONAPLEX_MODEL=base` for A/B comparisons. On a fresh browser,
the base selection also restores Assisted overlap handling, audio temperature
`0.7`, and repetition penalty `1.15`; saved user tuning remains untouched.

When the server log prints `serving static content from`, open the proxy URL from the pod (looks like `https://<pod-id>-8998.proxy.runpod.net/`). Click **Start**, allow microphone access, and speak.

To confirm TURN is doing its job: open `chrome://webrtc-internals` in another tab while a session is live. The active candidate pair under `selectedCandidatePairId` should have `relayProtocol: tcp` or `udp` and a remote address pointing at `turn.cloudflare.com`. If it shows `host` or `srflx` and you see no audio, TURN didn't engage.

## Voices

Pre-packaged voice embeddings:

- **Natural (female)**: NATF0, NATF1, NATF2, NATF3
- **Natural (male)**: NATM0, NATM1, NATM2, NATM3
- **Variety (female)**: VARF0 through VARF4
- **Variety (male)**: VARM0 through VARM4

You can also upload 10-30 s of clean audio for any speaker via the **Clone a voice** panel. Mono or stereo, any common format. The model uses it as a voice prefix and continues in that timbre. Not zero-shot perfect, but recognisable.

## Vision (optional)

Adds situational awareness from a screen share or virtual camera. Frames are sent to **Gemini 3.5 Flash** via the Interactions API; the one-sentence scene description is drip-fed into the model's text channel during natural silence windows so PersonaPlex stays contextually aware of what you're seeing without speaking the description aloud.

Enable it by providing `GEMINI_API_KEY` and clicking **Add Vision** in the UI. Without the key the button stays disabled and a toast explains why.

Controls:

- **Add Vision / Stop Vision**: start or end the capture stream.
- **Pause Vision / Resume Vision**: keep the stream open but stop sending frames.
- **Capture Now**: force a high-detail frame send immediately (bypasses motion gate and pause).
- **Rewind**: restore the last KV-cache snapshot if the model gets stuck. Auto-rewind also fires when the safety net trips 3+ times in 30 s.

The reaction selector has three explicit levels: **Captions only** keeps scene
descriptions outside the speech model, **After speech** queues one scene fact
after a user turn, and **Continuous** is an experimental ambient feed. The last
two inject text mid-stream and can alter the checkpoint's learned turn timing;
Captions only is the cleanest mode for evaluating native duplex behavior.

The **Vision Prompt** textarea in the config panel customizes the system prompt sent to Gemini at the start of each session. Frames are motion-gated client-side so static scenes don't waste calls. A live cost meter and a rolling caption history sit below the preview. The fallback frame interval is configurable; most frames are server-requested when the model just went silent, so the timer rarely fires in practice.

## Hardware

Use at least 24 GB VRAM for the resident model and rewind snapshot. Smaller cards require CPU offload or disabling periodic snapshots and will have higher latency.

## Architecture notes

Audio path:

1. Browser captures mic via `getUserMedia` and sends Opus-encoded frames over `RTCPeerConnection`.
2. Server (aiortc) decodes to 48 kHz, resamples to Mimi's 24 kHz, and feeds the inference pipeline. All model work stays on one persistent inference thread so CUDA context and graph state remain warm while the asyncio loop stays responsive.
3. TTS PCM goes back the same way: 24 kHz -> 48 kHz -> Opus -> `<audio>` element in the browser.
4. A `RTCDataChannel` labelled `control` carries the session config (voice, sampling parameters, prompts) and streams text tokens for the transcript.

Browser AEC, noise suppression, and AGC handle echo and ambient noise. Backgrounded tabs keep playing AI audio because WebRTC is treated as active media by the browser.

Single-session: `self.lock` in `ServerState` enforces one peer connection at a time. A second connect attempt while a session is live returns HTTP 409 `session_busy` instead of hanging.

Vision path (when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and the user enables it):

1. Browser motion-gates each captured frame and sends a base64 JPEG over the `control` DataChannel.
2. Server forwards the frame to Gemini 3.5 Flash via the Interactions API. Conversation state chains turn-to-turn through `previous_interaction_id`, so the model has long-term memory of prior frames.
3. The one-sentence description is tokenised and queued in `ServerState._vision_pending`.
4. `_process_audio_frame` drains one queued token per Mimi frame, but only when the model has been in a PAD streak for at least two frames. Outbound PCM is zeroed for the duration so the model never tries to speak the injection.
5. The caption is mirrored to the browser as a subtitle and added to the rolling history log.

## Known issues

These come from the upstream model, not the RunPod packaging:

- **Response looping**: under certain prompts the model can repeat itself. Native RL defaults leave repetition and PAD bias off so they do not distort learned turn timing; max-turn and auto-rewind remain circuit breakers, and the Advanced panel exposes anti-loop overrides.
- **Research checkpoint**: the default RL model is non-commercial and its published evaluation is automated. Conversation-data style can affect safety behavior; review the model card before deploying it beyond research or personal evaluation.
- **Pipeline efficiency**: GPU utilisation is occasionally spiky; some kernels are not yet optimised.

Base-model issues belong upstream at [NVIDIA/personaplex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/personaplex/issues); RL-checkpoint behavior belongs with [Kyutai's model](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/personaplex-rl-seamless). Bugs in the RunPod packaging or WebRTC client belong here.

## Local dev

If you want to run outside RunPod (LAN only, no TURN required since both peers can reach each other directly):

```bash
uv sync --frozen
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run frontend:build
uv run moshi-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8998 --voice-prompt-dir voices
```

Voice prompts need to be downloaded manually (see `start.sh` for the HuggingFace pull recipe) or symlinked from a previous RunPod volume.

Run the resampler smoke tests:

```bash
uv run python moshi/tests/test_rtc_resampler.py
```
