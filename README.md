PersonaPlex is a real-time, full-duplex speech-to-speech model with persona control via text prompts and voice conditioning. This fork packages it as a single-template RunPod deployment with a WebRTC browser client and a one-shot bootstrap script.

## Deploy on RunPod

### 1. HuggingFace token

Create a **Read** token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and accept the model license at [nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1).

### 2. Cloudflare TURN credentials

WebRTC media is UDP. RunPod's `*.proxy.runpod.net` is Cloudflare-fronted and only carries HTTP/WS, so the browser needs a TURN relay to reach the pod. Cloudflare's free tier covers a personal voice agent comfortably (1 TB egress/month).

1. Sign in to Cloudflare. Dashboard -> **Realtime** -> **TURN Server**.
2. Click **Create TURN App**, name it.
3. Copy the **Turn Token ID** and **API Token**. The API token is shown once. Lose it and you regenerate.

### 3. RunPod secrets

In the RunPod console, go to **Secrets** -> **Create secret** and add the following. `GEMINI_API_KEY` is optional and only required if you want the Vision feature.

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace Read token |
| `TURN_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare Turn Token ID |
| `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API Token |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio key (optional; enables Vision) |

### 4. Pod template

Create a Pod template (Templates -> New Template). Settings:

- **Type**: Pod
- **Compute**: NVIDIA GPU
- **Container image**: `runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.1-devel-ubuntu22.04`
- **Container disk**: 20 GB
- **Volume disk**: 40 GB
- **Volume mount path**: `/workspace`

**Container start command**:

```bash
bash -c "curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camjac251/Personaplex-runpod/main/start.sh -o /workspace/start.sh && chmod +x /workspace/start.sh && /workspace/start.sh & /start.sh"
```

**HTTP ports**: `8998` (PersonaPlex). `8888` (JupyterLab) is optional.

**TCP ports**: none.

**Environment variables**:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_HF_TOKEN }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_ID` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_ID }}` |
| `TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN }}` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `{{ RUNPOD_SECRET_GEMINI_API_KEY }}` (optional) |

### 5. Launch and connect

Pick a GPU with at least 12 GB VRAM (RTX 4090 / A6000 / L40S all work). Start the pod with the template above.

First boot downloads ~14 GB of weights and voice prompts. Expect 30-60 minutes depending on the data centre. The volume disk caches them, so subsequent boots reach "ready" in under a minute.

When the server log prints `Serving embedded web client (no build required)`, open the proxy URL from the pod (looks like `https://<pod-id>-8998.proxy.runpod.net/`). Click **Connect**, allow microphone access, and speak.

To confirm TURN is doing its job: open `chrome://webrtc-internals` in another tab while a session is live. The active candidate pair under `selectedCandidatePairId` should have `relayProtocol: tcp` or `udp` and a remote address pointing at `turn.cloudflare.com`. If it shows `host` or `srflx` and you see no audio, TURN didn't engage.

## Voices

Pre-packaged voice embeddings:

- **Natural (female)**: NATF0, NATF1, NATF2, NATF3
- **Natural (male)**: NATM0, NATM1, NATM2, NATM3
- **Variety (female)**: VARF0 through VARF4
- **Variety (male)**: VARM0 through VARM4

You can also upload 10-30 s of clean audio for any speaker via the **Clone a voice** panel. Mono or stereo, any common format. The model uses it as a voice prefix and continues in that timbre. Not zero-shot perfect, but recognisable.

## Vision (optional)

Adds situational awareness from a screen share or virtual camera. Frames are sent to **Gemini 3.5 Flash** via the Interactions API; the one-sentence scene description is drip-fed into the model's text channel during natural silence windows so PersonaPlex stays contextually aware of what you're seeing without speaking the description aloud.

Enable it by providing `GEMINI_API_KEY` and clicking **Add Vision** in the UI. Without the key the button stays disabled and a toast explains why.

Controls:

- **Add Vision / Stop Vision**: start or end the capture stream.
- **Pause Vision / Resume Vision**: keep the stream open but stop sending frames.
- **Capture Now**: force a high-detail frame send immediately (bypasses motion gate and pause).
- **Rewind**: restore the last KV-cache snapshot if the model gets stuck. Auto-rewind also fires when the safety net trips 3+ times in 30 s.

The **Vision Prompt** textarea in the config panel customizes the system prompt sent to Gemini at the start of each session. Frames are motion-gated client-side so static scenes don't waste calls. A live cost meter and a rolling caption history sit below the preview. The fallback frame interval is configurable; most frames are server-requested when the model just went silent, so the timer rarely fires in practice.

## Hardware

Tested on RTX 4090 (24 GB) with the default RunPod driver. Any modern NVIDIA card with 12 GB+ VRAM should work. Smaller cards can run with CPU offload at the cost of latency.

## Architecture notes

Audio path:

1. Browser captures mic via `getUserMedia` and sends Opus-encoded frames over `RTCPeerConnection`.
2. Server (aiortc) decodes to 48 kHz, resamples to Mimi's 24 kHz, feeds the inference pipeline. GPU work runs in a thread executor so the asyncio loop stays responsive.
3. TTS PCM goes back the same way: 24 kHz -> 48 kHz -> Opus -> `<audio>` element in the browser.
4. A `RTCDataChannel` labelled `control` carries the session config (voice, sampling parameters, prompts) and streams text tokens for the transcript.

Browser AEC, noise suppression, and AGC handle echo and ambient noise. Backgrounded tabs keep playing AI audio because WebRTC is treated as active media by the browser.

Single-session: `self.lock` in `ServerState` enforces one peer connection at a time. A second connect attempt while a session is live returns HTTP 409 `session_busy` instead of hanging.

Vision path (when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and the user enables it):

1. Browser motion-gates each captured frame and sends a base64 JPEG over the `control` DataChannel.
2. Server forwards the frame to Gemini 3.5 Flash via the Interactions API. Conversation state chains turn-to-turn through `previous_interaction_id`, so the model has long-term memory of prior frames.
3. The one-sentence description is tokenised and queued in `ServerState._vision_pending`.
4. `_process_audio_frame` drains one queued token per Mimi frame, but only when the model has been in a PAD streak for at least two frames. Outbound PCM is zeroed for the duration so the model never tries to speak the injection.
5. The caption is mirrored to the browser as a subtitle and added to the rolling history log.

## Known issues

These come from the upstream model, not the RunPod packaging:

- **Response looping**: under certain prompts the model can repeat itself. The repetition penalty, padding bonus, and max-turn-length sliders in the Advanced panel ship with sane defaults that mitigate this; auto-rewind also catches rare cases where the safety net fires repeatedly.
- **Pipeline efficiency**: GPU utilisation is occasionally spiky; some kernels are not yet optimised.

Core model issues belong upstream at [NVIDIA/personaplex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/personaplex/issues). Bugs in the RunPod packaging or WebRTC client belong here.

## Local dev

If you want to run outside RunPod (LAN only, no TURN required since both peers can reach each other directly):

```bash
uv sync --frozen
uv run moshi-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8998 --static none --voice-prompt-dir voices
```

Voice prompts need to be downloaded manually (see `start.sh` for the HuggingFace pull recipe) or symlinked from a previous RunPod volume.

Run the resampler smoke tests:

```bash
uv run python moshi/tests/test_rtc_resampler.py
```
